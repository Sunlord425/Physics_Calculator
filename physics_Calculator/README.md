This is just a little calculator that I'm making because I don't like having to do physics problem in class.

to run it:
1. Make sure you have python installed on your computer
2. open terminal
3. enter "python {filepath}"
    (You can copy filepath by right clicking a file and holding the option key)
    Example: python /Users/<User>/Python/physics_Calculator/physicsCalc.py
